        <h2>About me:</h2>
        <p><strong><u>For all my life,</u></strong> I never knew how to build an aesthetic or althetic
            body. I reunited all the information that I learned in 7 years. I
            started my body transformation since I was 7 years old when I started
            to swim, I started weightlifting at 14 year old and it litterally helped
            me in all of my sports performance and enhanced my body transformation. If you are here on this website, it means that you have tried all the things so far and these didn't work or you are just new with fitness and you don't have the knowledge to start your fitness journey. Here on this website, I can offer you some great knowledge and advice that are proven by science and are no BS.</p>
    
       <h2><u>Swimming</u> Workout Template</h2>
       <p><br>Here is a workout that will change your life,<br>to build an aesthetic
           body or to get better at sports(swimming).</p>
       <ul>
           <li><a href="file:///home/chronos/u-60a528057930933e896cdd278e74a7eed1535739/MyFiles/Downloads/Workout%20schedule%203%20days%20-%20Google%C2%A0Documents.pdf" target="_blank">Weightlifting for Swimming</a></li>
           
       
       </ul>
       
       <h2>How to get aesthetic</h2>
       <p> <i>Getting aesthetic is a lifestyle</i>, it takes time to build an asthetic body
           but, with this knowledge that I will put under this paragraph, you will build
           an asthetic body <strong><u>FASTER</u></strong> than most people ever will.
       
       <p> The muscles responsable for an asthetic body are: the lats, the mid
           delt, the abs and legs. I added legs because if you have small legs,
           you look kinda stupid. The lats and the mid delt are responsable for the v taper look
           on your body and the abs helps you look lean. If you want to have an
           asthetic body, focus on these muscles but train the other muscles too, just focus more on these muscles.</p>
